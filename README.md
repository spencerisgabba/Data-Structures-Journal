# Data-Structures-Journal
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main issues I faced in this course are related to C++ and CSV loading syntax. Data structures don’t change a lot between languages, and there already exists an optimized structure for every language on Stack Overflow. Overall I love data structures so it was very enjoyable, and C++ was the right choice considering all the ingrained structures in Python. 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I went back through the course material since it directly relates to the projects. Data structures are important to understand as math is important to learn, they help people, programmers especially, understand the world around them. Data structures are used in every single commercial algorithm, so it’s a must.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
As stated above, you cannot write commercial code without engaging in some sort of data structure. Even privately, data structures can be used to help automate important tasks and organize data.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Comments! I really enjoy the big comment on top of the function which describes the entire function. It helps me understand the function of the function.
